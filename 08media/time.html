<div class="content-box">
    <h2>Prehistoric</h2>
    <h3>40,000 BCE - 2,000 BCE</h3>
    <p>Prehistoric art includes some of the earliest known expressions of human creativity, such as <b>cave paintings</b>, <b>sculptures</b>, and <b>carvings</b>. This art primarily served functional and symbolic purposes, often depicting animals, hunting scenes, or human figures, which may have had ritualistic, spiritual, or communicative significance. Its importance lies in its role in understanding early human cognition, belief systems, and social organization. These artworks offer valuable insight into the mindset, environment, and cultural practices of our ancient ancestors, marking the beginnings of human expression and communication beyond simple survival.</p>
    <h2>Ancient Art</h2>
    <h3>3,000 BCE - 400 CE</h3>
    <p>Ancient art is characterized by its diverse styles and the rise of complex civilizations like Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, Rome, and India. This period saw the development of <b>monumental architecture</b>, <b>sculpture</b>, <b>pottery</b>, and <b>frescoes</b>, often reflecting religious, political, and social themes. Art became a tool for propaganda, worship, and the representation of power, with rulers commissioning works to immortalize their reigns. The importance of ancient art lies in its ability to preserve historical events, cultural values, and ideologies, giving us a window into the beliefs, aesthetics, and advancements of ancient societies. These works laid the foundation for Western and Eastern artistic traditions that continue to influence art and architecture today.</p>
    <h2>Medieval Art</h2>
    <h3>400 - 1400</h3>
    <p>Medieval art is defined by its strong religious themes, as Christianity dominated Europe during this period. Art took the form of <b>illuminated manuscripts</b>, <b>stained glass</b>, <b>frescoes</b>, and <b>sculptures</b>, with a focus on biblical stories, saints, and religious symbolism. Unlike classical art, medieval works often prioritized spiritual significance over realism, leading to stylized figures and abstract representations. The importance of medieval art lies in its role as a vehicle for religious education and its influence on the cultural and architectural developments of the Middle Ages, such as the construction of cathedrals and the creation of sacred art. It also laid the groundwork for the later Renaissance, blending classical traditions with Christian ideals.</p>
    <h2>Renaissance</h2>
    <h3>14th - 17th Century</h3>
    <p>Renaissance art is characterized by a renewed interest in classical Greek and Roman ideals, with a focus on <b>naturalism</b>, <b>perspective</b>, and <b>human anatomy</b>. Artists like Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael emphasized <b>realistic proportions</b>, <b>depth</b>, and the <b>beauty of the human form</b>, often portraying both religious and secular subjects. The period also saw the rise of patronage, with wealthy families and the Church commissioning works that celebrated both divine and human achievements. Renaissance art's importance lies in its transformation of artistic techniques, its role in the intellectual movement of humanism, and its lasting influence on Western art and culture, shaping the modern understanding of aesthetics and creativity.</p>
    <h2>Baroque</h2>
    <h3>1600 - mid 170</h3>
    <p>Baroque art is known for its <b>dramatic use of light and shadow</b>, <b>intense emotion</b>, and a <b>sense of movement</b> and grandeur. It often featured <b>bold contrasts</b>, <b>rich color palettes</b>, and <b>dynamic compositions</b>, creating a feeling of energy and immediacy. Artists like Caravaggio, Bernini, and Rembrandt emphasized realism and intense emotional expression, frequently portraying religious themes, power, and human struggle. The importance of Baroque art lies in its ability to engage the viewer emotionally, reflecting the turbulent political and religious climate of the time, especially the Counter-Reformation. It also influenced architecture and design, leading to the development of ornate and awe-inspiring structures like the Palace of Versailles and St. Peter's Basilica.</p>
    <h2>Rococo</h2>
    <h3>Early 1700s</h3>
    <p> Rococo art is characterized by its <b>lightness</b>, <b>elegance</b>, and <b>playfulness</b>, with a focus on <b>intricate details</b>, <b>pastel colors</b>, and <b>curvilinear forms</b>. It often featured themes of romance, leisure, and mythological scenes, marked by delicate brushwork and ornate decorations. Unlike the grandeur of Baroque, Rococo art was more intimate and whimsical, frequently found in the salons and private spaces of the aristocracy. The importance of Rococo art lies in its reflection of the changing tastes of the French aristocracy during the reign of Louis XV, as it embodied the carefree, hedonistic spirit of the time. It also set the stage for the eventual rise of Neoclassicism, which sought a return to more restrained, classical ideals.</p>
    <h2>Neoclassicism</h2>
    <h3>Mid 1700 - Early 1800</h3>
    <p>Neoclassicism was characterized by a return to the ideals of ancient Greece and Rome, emphasizing <b>simplicity</b>, <b>order</b>, and <b>symmetry</b>. Artists focused on <b>clean lines</b>, <b>balanced compositions</b>, and <b>restrained color palettes</b>, often depicting historical, mythological, or moral subjects with a sense of stoicism and rationality. Figures like Jacques-Louis David championed the movement, reflecting the Enlightenment’s emphasis on reason and civic virtue. Neoclassicism’s importance lies in its rejection of the excesses of Rococo and its role in shaping the cultural landscape of the time, influencing both art and politics. It also aligned with the ideals of the French Revolution and later became a symbol of rationality and progress during the rise of modernity.</p>
    <h2>Romanticism</h2>
    <h3>Late 1700 - Mid 1800</h3>
    <p>Romanticism was characterized by an emphasis on emotion, individualism, and the sublime in nature. It rejected the rationality of Neoclassicism, focusing instead on <b>dramatic landscapes</b>, <b>intense color</b>, and subjects like heroism, revolution, and the mysteries of the human experience. Artists like J.M.W. Turner, Eugene Delacroix, and Francisco Goya explored themes of awe, passion, and the power of nature, often conveying a sense of <b>movement</b> and <b>energy</b>. Romanticism’s importance lies in its challenge to traditional conventions, reflecting the social, political, and cultural upheavals of the time, such as the French Revolution and the Industrial Revolution. It also paved the way for modern art by celebrating the subjective, emotional side of human experience.</p>
    <h2>Realism</h2>
    <h3>Mid 1800s</h3>
    <p>Realism focused on depicting everyday life with accuracy and objectivity, often highlighting the struggles of ordinary people. Artists rejected the idealized subjects of Romanticism and Neoclassicism, instead portraying scenes from labor, poverty, and social issues, with a focus on truthful representation rather than idealization or dramatization. Figures like Gustave Courbet and Jean-François Millet <b>emphasized scenes of rural life</b> and <b>urban poverty</b>, bringing attention to the dignity of the working class. The importance of Realism lies in its shift toward portraying the harsh realities of life, challenging romanticized notions and reflecting the social and political changes of the time, particularly the rise of industrialization and the growing awareness of class inequality. It laid the foundation for later movements like Impressionism and modern art.</p>
    <h2>Impressionism</h2>
    <h3>1860 - 1880</h3>
    <p>Impressionism, flourishing from the 1860s to the 1880s, is known for its focus on capturing fleeting moments of light and color, often painted en plein air (outdoors) to capture the immediacy of a scene. Artists like Claude Monet , Edgar Degas, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir used <b>loose brushstrokes</b>, <b>lighter color palettes</b>, and a focus on everyday life to evoke a sense of atmosphere and <b>movement</b> rather than precise detail. The importance of Impressionism lies in its break from traditional artistic conventions, such as the rigid rules of academic painting. It emphasized subjective perception and the transient qualities of nature, influencing future developments in modern art by paving the way for movements like Post-Impressionism and abstract art.</p>
    <h2>Post-Impressionism</h2>
    <h3>1880 - 1900</h3>
    <p>Post-Impressionism is characterized by a shift from the spontaneous, fleeting qualities of Impressionism to a more subjective and expressive approach to art. Artists like Vincent van Gogh, Paul Cézanne, Georges Seurat, and Paul Gauguin emphasized personal emotion, <b>bold colors</b>, and innovative use of form. They explored <b>structure</b>, <b>symbolism</b>, and <b>color theory</b>, pushing beyond Impressionism’s focus on light and nature. Post-Impressionism paved the way for modern art movements, influencing later styles like Fauvism, Cubism, and Expressionism, by encouraging experimentation and the expression of inner experience over objective reality.</p>
    <h2>Cubism</h2>
    <h3>1907 - 917</h3>
    <p>Cubism, developed by artists like Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, revolutionized art by breaking objects and subjects into fragmented, <b>geometric shapes</b>, presenting multiple viewpoints simultaneously. Instead of depicting objects from a single perspective, Cubists used abstract forms to represent the complexity of human perception. The movement is known for its <b>flat planes</b>, <b>overlapping forms</b>, and use of <b>monochromatic color palettes</b>, which challenged traditional concepts of perspective and representation. The importance of Cubism lies in its radical departure from realism and its role in laying the foundation for modern abstract art. It reshaped how artists viewed and represented the world, influencing numerous 20th-century movements, including Futurism, Dadaism, and Surrealism.</p>
    <h2>Surrealism</h2>
    <h3>1920 - 1950</h3>
    <p>Surrealism is characterized by its exploration of the unconscious mind, dreams, and the irrational. Artists like Salvador Dalí, René Magritte, and Max Ernst used bizarre, often fantastical imagery to challenge reality and depict the strange and the surreal. Techniques like <b>automatic drawing</b>, <b>collage</b>, and unexpected juxtapositions created <b>dreamlike scenes</b> that blurred the boundaries between fantasy and reality. The importance of Surrealism lies in its embrace of psychological exploration and its rebellion against conventional thought, drawing on Freudian and Marxist ideas to critique society and explore deeper human emotions. It had a profound influence on literature, film, and later developments in abstract and conceptual art.</p>
    <h2>Abstract Expressionism</h2>
    <h3>1940 - 1960</h3>
    <p>Abstract Expressionism is known for its emphasis on spontaneous, non-representational expression through <b>bold color</b>, <b>energetic brushwork</b>, and <b>dramatic</b>, <b>large-scale compositions</b>. Artists like Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, and Willem de Kooning focused on conveying raw emotion and inner psychological states rather than depicting recognizable forms or scenes. The movement prioritized the act of painting itself—often embracing chance, movement, and texture—as a means of personal expression. The importance of Abstract Expressionism lies in its rejection of traditional artistic constraints and its exploration of the subconscious. It marked a shift in the art world, positioning New York as the new center of the art world and influencing later movements such as Minimalism and Conceptual Art.</p>
    <h2>Pop Art</h2>
    <h3>1950 - 196</h3>
    <p>Pop Art is characterized by its embrace of popular culture, mass media, and consumerism. Artists like Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, and Claes Oldenburg used <b>bold</b>, <b>bright colors</b>, <b>commercial imagery</b>, and <b>everyday objects</b>, often elevating items like soup cans, comic strips, and advertisements to the status of fine art. The movement blurred the boundaries between high art and low culture, challenging traditional ideas about originality, value, and artistic expression. Pop Art's importance lies in its critique and celebration of consumerism and mass production, reflecting the rise of media and the burgeoning consumer culture in post-war society. It also helped redefine art in the context of modern life, influencing everything from design to advertising.</p>
    <h2>Minimalism</h2>
    <h3>1960 - 1970</h3>
    <p>Minimalism is characterized by its simplicity, focusing on <b>geometric shapes</b>, <b>clean lines</b>, and the use of industrial materials like <b>steel</b>, <b>glass</b>, and <b>concrete</b>. Artists such as Donald Judd, Frank Stella, and Dan Flavin stripped away all unnecessary details, reducing artworks to their most basic forms to emphasize purity and objectivity. The movement rejected the emotional intensity of Abstract Expressionism and sought to create art that was impersonal, often emphasizing the physical space around the artwork as much as the object itself. Minimalism's importance lies in its challenge to traditional notions of art, focusing on the experience of the viewer and influencing design, architecture, and even music. It helped pave the way for later conceptual and postmodern art movements.</p>
    <h2>Contemporary</h2>
    <h3>1980 - Present</h3>
    <p>Contemporary art is marked by its diversity, experimentation, and engagement with current social, political, and cultural issues. Artists use a wide range of media, including <b>digital art</b>, <b>performance</b>, <b>installation</b>, <b>video</b>, and <b>mixed media</b>, often blurring the boundaries between genres and challenging traditional notions of what art can be. Influential figures like Jeff Koons, Damien Hirst, and Ai Weiwei explore themes such as identity, globalization, technology, and environmental concerns. The importance of contemporary art lies in its reflection of the complexities of modern life, pushing the boundaries of expression and encouraging critical dialogue. It embraces global perspectives and often seeks to involve the viewer in the artistic process, redefining art as an ever-evolving, inclusive conversation.</p>

    <h3>Tools for Telling What Art is From When</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Iconography</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Recognize symbols and motifs specific to certain periods, cultures, or religions (e.g., Christian symbolism in Medieval art, classical mythology in Renaissance art).</li>
                <li>Objects like halos, angels, or specific poses can indicate religious themes, while certain symbols might hint at a specific time period.</li>
    </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Style and Technique</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Brushwork and Painting Technique:</strong> Loose, expressive brushstrokes often signal Impressionism, while highly detailed, controlled techniques are characteristic of Renaissance or Baroque art.</li>
                <li><strong>Sculptural Techniques:</strong> Realism and idealized human forms suggest the Classical or Renaissance periods, while more abstract or expressive forms might point to Modernism.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Materials and Mediums</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The use of materials like <strong>oil paints</strong> vs <strong>tempera</strong> or <strong>fresco</strong> can help date a work. For example, oil painting became dominant in the Northern Renaissance, while frescos were popular in earlier periods like the Italian Renaissance.</li>
                <li><strong>Canvas vs Wood Panels:</strong> Renaissance and later art often used canvas, while earlier works of art used wood panels.
            </ul>
